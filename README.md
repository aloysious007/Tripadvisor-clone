🎯 Why I Built It
As part of my full-stack learning journey, I wanted to replicate the visual feel of a production-grade travel site. This helped sharpen my layout skills, semantic HTML structure, and styling techniques — especially working with nested flexbox structures and image alignment without sacrificing design responsiveness.

⚙️ What’s Next?
This version is static, but I plan to:

Add JavaScript interactivity for search suggestions

Implement filtering and sorting features

Integrate a backend for reviews, bookings, and location data
